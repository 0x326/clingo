# Clingo: A grounder and solver for logic programs

*Answer Set Programming* (ASP) offers a simple and powerful modeling language
to describe combinatorial problems as *logic programs*.  The *clingo* system
then takes such a logic program and computes *answer sets* representing
solutions to the given problem.  To get an idea, check our [Getting
Started](https://potassco.org/doc/start/) page.
